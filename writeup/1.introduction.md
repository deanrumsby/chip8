# Introduction

This write up is intended to assist anyone who would like to start learning about emulator development but doesn't know where to start. 

The Chip8 is often recommended as the first "console" to emulate, since it is incredibly simple compared to other machines. 

I would like to provide a very simple structure for implementing such a emulator. Starting with as basic as possible an implementation, written in JavaScript. Then taking that concept and building the same emulator again but this time in Zig and compiling down to WASM (so we can still make use of the browser). 

I'm making this mostly for fun, and honestly as a way to provide myself some focus. I have been stuck in programming limbo for a while now, and would like to continue working on emulators myself. So this is my attempt at motivating myself.

Have fun! 

Dean.
